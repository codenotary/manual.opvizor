# Design your own dashboards

An essential characteristic of the opvizor PerfAnalyzer is the ability
to define their own dashboards, as well as to adapt the existing
dashboards to your individual needs. opvizor-PerfAnalyzer focuses on the
analysis of the data that is important to you. 

The following instructions should illustrate examples how you you design
new views. 

  

1.  Create a new dashboard. To do this open the Dasboard-list and click
    the button under the list \[**+ New**\]   
      
2.  An empty dashboard shows up. Dashboards are built up line by
    line. The first line is already set. Click on the small
    yellow-green rectangle and create a new Graph Panel  
     
3.  Choose a metric you are interested in.   
       
4.  Change the name of the dashboard - click on the **gear** icon to the
    left of the dashboard menu and select "**Settings**"  
5.  Save the dashboard by clicking on the **disk** next to the dashboard
    list  
6.  You can export your dashboard if you want to share it or if you like
    to import it later in another installation of the opvizor
    PerfAnalyzer – to do so, choose the gear icon left of the dashboard
    list and select "**Export**"
