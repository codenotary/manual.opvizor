# Playlists

A playlist rotates through a pre-selected list of Dashboards. A Playlist
is a great way to build situational awareness, or show your metrics to
your team or visitors.

The following dashboards a good mix in my case as I want to see the
common vital signs of my hosts and vms as well as the application
itself:

  - Highlights: Virtual Machines

<!-- end list -->

  - VMware vSphere Health Status
  - VMware Performance: VM Cluster
  - SQL Server Monitoring
