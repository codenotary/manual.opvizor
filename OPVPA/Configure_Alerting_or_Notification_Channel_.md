# Configure Alerting (or Notification Channel)

It is a good idea to set alerts in certain situations. Examples would
be, when you have exceeded a threshold such as the number of snapshots
or the amount of memory consumed.

Specific **alerts can only to be set on any dashboard graph panel**
using the Alert tab widget. You must save the Alert to the dashboard to
continue using it in the future. See
