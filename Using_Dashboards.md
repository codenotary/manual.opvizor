    More dashboards (supplied separately) can be loaded with the
    \[**Import**\] button at the bottom of the list. 
2.  If you want to change the time range in the dashboard, click on
    the **Clock symbol** in the top-right corner:

    You can select a "Quick range", or you can set an individual time
    period selecting a "Time range". Have fun trying out the
    dashboard\!
